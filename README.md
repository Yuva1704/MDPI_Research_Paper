Abstract: The creep rupture life of 5Cr-0.5Mo steels used in high-temperature applications is significantly influenced by factors such as minor alloying elements, hardness, austenite grain size, non-metallic inclusions, service temperature, and applied stress. The relation
ship of these variables with the creep rupture life is quite complex. In this study, the creep rupture life of 5Cr-0.5Mo steel was predicted using various machine learning(ML) models. To achieve higher accuracy, various ML techniques including random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), linear regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), ada boost (AB), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were applied with careful optimization of hidden parameters. Among these, the ANN-based model demonstrated superior performance, yielding high accuracy with minimal prediction errors for the test dataset (RMSE= 0.069, MAE=0.053, MAPE= 0.014, and R2= 1). Additionally, we developed a user-friendly 
graphical user interface (GUI) for the ANN model, enabling users to predict and optimize creep rupture life. This tool helps materials scientists and industrialists prevent failures in high-temperature applications and design steel compositions with enhanced creep resistance.
